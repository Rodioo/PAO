# University project for the Advanced OOP course.
- Written in Java using JavaFX for the GUI and JDBC with MySQL for the database. 

- The GUI and the database were tied together using the MVC pattern.


## The project is an e-learning platform where students and teachers can interact through courses.

### Some of the project functionalities:

- A user can register with an username, email and a password (all validated with regex patterns) and has the option to be a student or a teacher.
- A user can login with the username and password and the application will tell if he's a student or a teacher and change the UI accordingly.
- If a user forgets his password he can easily recover it with his email.
- A teacher can add a course, chapters for the course, and multiple questions for each chapter through a smooth UI.
- A student gets 2 course recommendations and can enroll in one of the courses. After enrolling he can iterate through each chapter, answer to questions to get rewarded with points and finish a course after solving all questions from each chapter.
- If the student decides to exit he can come back to the course he enrolled, at the exact same chapter he left seeing how much progress he made.
- A student can become a premium student with points from the courses questions, therefore unlocking premium courses.
